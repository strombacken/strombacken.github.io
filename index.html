<h1>Strombacken</h1>
<h2>Retreat and Healing Center</h2>
<img src="strombacken.png" width="800" height="450" alt="Strombacken" />
<p>Strombacken spiritual retreat and healing center is located in
north-central Sweden.</p>
<p>For several summers, Ozay has worked on restoring
the main house and barn, so that they can serve those who will benefit
from spiritual practice in quiet, forested surroundings.</p>
<p>Ahiranta bought the property in Sweden in September 2004,
following guidance received in meditation. It was built
in 1869 and consists of a large main house, traditionally built with
logs; a barn; a store house; a garage; and a stable, which was 
added in 1949. The buildings had not been lived in for a decade 
before the property was acquired for spiritual purposes.</p>
<p>The center was bought with the intention of creating a circle
of light, where people who feel the need can spend time away from the
society they are used to. This will offer them a time to reflect on
life. Once the center is finished, it will reach out, giving spiritual
healing to all beings in society who are looking for help and support.</p>
<p>No personal financial gain will be made by any being within or outside
this retreat. Funding is coming from the whole to make it possible to
reach out to those in spiritual need. Ahiranta and Ozay function as the
custodians of this wonderful, secluded retreat in the middle of nowhere
in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Getting to Stockholm</h2>
<img src="map-stockholm.png" width="800" height="450" alt="Stockholm" />
<p>If you live outside Sweden, the first thing to do is to get to the
Swedish capital of Stockholm. There are two airports near Stockholm.
Arlanda (airline code ARN) is the big one, located about 37 kilometers
(25 miles) north of Stockholm. Arlanda is served by major scheduled
airlines such as British Airways (BA), SAS Scandinavian Airlines (SK),
Lufthansa (LH), and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KL). Skavsta (airline code
NYO) is the smaller airport. It is about 100 kilometers (62 miles)
south of Stockholm, near the town of Nyköping. Low-cost airline Ryanair
flies into Skavsta. Both airports are connected to Stockholm by public
ground transportation.</p>
<p>If you want to get to Sweden by train, you can take a Eurostar train
from London to Brussels, then Deutsche Bahn Intercity Express (ICE)
trains to Köln (Cologne), Odense, and Copenhagen, then Swedish SJ X2000
trains to Malmö and Stockholm.</p>
<p>For car drivers, highway E20 takes you from Copenhagen, Denmark, to
Malmö and Helsingborg in Sweden. From there, highway E4 takes you north
to Stockholm.</p>
<h2>From Stockholm to Ytterhogdal</h2>
<img src="map-ytterhogdal.png" width="800" height="450" alt="Ytterhogdal" />
<p>Stockholm Arlanda has a train station in the basement named Arlanda C.
If you go to the Swedish Railways website, you can reserve a combined
train and bus ticket from Arlanda C to Ytterhogdal. The train takes you
from Arlanda C to the town of Mora in about three hours, and then a
country bus takes you from Mora to Ytterhogdal in another three hours or
so. This route avoids having to go into downtown Stockholm.</p>
<p>If you are already in downtown Stockholm, a different company
(Harjedalingen) has a bus that runs direct from Stockholm Cityterminalen
to Ytterhogdal.</p>
<p>If you are driving, you can of course take the E4 and route 83 north
from Stockholm to Ytterhogdal in about 5 hours. There are also a few
regional airlines in Sweden, such as Nextjet, that operate local flights
to smaller towns within Sweden. However, the flights to any given place
often operate only a few times each week, once a day at most, and the
days and times may not be convenient.</p>
